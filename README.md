MuggleTasks 

"MuggleTasks" is an enchanting to-do list application designed for wizards, witches, and even muggles to organize their daily tasks with a touch of magic. Cast away chaos and conjure productivity with every decree you inscribe!

About The Project

Users can manage their "decrees" (tasks), set "prophecy dates" (due dates), and assign "urgency levels" to prioritize their magical endeavors. The entire user interface is designed to feel like a magical artifact, with custom fonts, colors, and themes.
